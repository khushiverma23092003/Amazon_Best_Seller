Amazon Best Sellers Analysis with Pandas

Objective
Build a comprehensive data exploration and analysis pipeline for Amazon's best-selling books using Pandas.
Project Description:-
*This project likely involves working with a CSV dataset of Amazon’s bestselling books (spanning a decade, for instance) and performing an end-to-end data analytics workflow:

1.Importing and Exploring Data
Use Pandas to read the CSV, explore the dataset's structure—columns for book titles, authors, categories, prices, ratings, reviews, and years (e.g., 2009–2019) 

2.Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
Handle missing values or inconsistencies.

3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Apply Pandas (and possibly visualization libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn) to uncover:
*Genre distribution over years
*Cover type prevalence (hardcover vs paperback)
*Top authors and frequently appearing bestsellers
*Price vs review trends to assess correlations 

4.Output & Reporting
Give a csv file of top authors and average rating by genre.

Key Skills Demonstrated:-
*Proficiency in data ingestion, cleaning, and preprocessing using Pandas
*Strong EDA capabilities, including visualization and trend analysis
*Experience in turning raw data into actionable, narrative-driven analysis



Showcases the ability to blend technical data skills (Python/Pandas) with AI-driven narrative generation.

Ideal for roles requiring analytical intake and client-facing storytelling.
